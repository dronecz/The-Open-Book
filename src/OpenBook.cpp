             have omitted this chip.

 @param spi Address of the SPI bus for the screen and SRAM chip.
 @param width Native width of the display
 @param height Native height of the display
 @returns always returns true for now
 @note A medium-term term goal is to write our own driver for the screen and
       have it live in this repository. For now, we're using the Adafruit_IL0398
       driver. Refresh rate is honestly a bit slow, and I know this screen can
       refresh faster because the GxEPD2 library is downright snappy. GxEPD2
       also has LUTs for partial refresh, which I think we want to port over.
